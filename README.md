## UI Components
This repo contains UI components built with JS, HTML, and CSS, with the goal of taking my frontend experience to the next level. 
Upon running the html file you'll find that all the components are laid out like how one would view a Jupyter Notebook, 
and it starts with the basics and then builds up from there.

The Three.js library is used primarily, as I have a strong interest in developing dynamic effects with particles.

- Card Array
